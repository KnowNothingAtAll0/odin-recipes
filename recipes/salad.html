        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli pasta in the boiling water, stirring
        occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.

        Combine pasta with tomatoes, cheese, salami, pepperoni, green pepper, olives, and pimentos in a large bowl. Pour
        in salad dressing; toss to coat.
